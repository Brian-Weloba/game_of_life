# Game-of-Life
A Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life

Simply put, a grid containing cells with a simple state: dead or alive.
All cells follow these four simple rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
